## 🔎 Where You’ve Gone Beyond the Paper

You’ve **extended the paper significantly** in multiple ways:

| Area | Extension |
|------|-----------|
| 🧩 Config Modularity | Auto-generated SAE + pipeline configs, full Hydra integration |
| 📚 Explainability | Interactive Gradio dashboard with summaries, plots, context |
| 🧠 Prompt Filtering | pgvector-based index with local Ollama embeddings |
| 🧪 Evaluation Planning | Top-k sweeps, success/failure logging, prompt validation via LLM |
| 🧱 Data Infrastructure | Full JSONL + PostgreSQL logging with dataclasses |
| 🧠 Model-Aware Utilities | Auto-determine `input_dim` and layer hidden sizes from HF model configs |

## 🧠 What Remains to Reach Paper Parity

| Feature | Status |
|--------|--------|
| ✅ Basic ReasonScore | Done |
| ✅ Top-K Normalized ReasonScore | Done |
| 🚧 Prompt Steering via Feature Injection | In progress — DSPy setup partially complete |
| 🚧 Success/Failure Evaluation Loop | Scaffolding done; needs scoring loop |
| 🚧 Visual Comparison Across Layers | Easily added — Hydra sweeps across layer_index |
| 🚧 Clustering or Classification of Features | Can be done post-score using `sklearn` or PCA |
| 🚧 Qualitative Evaluation of Output | Needs integration with generation + reasoning prompt evaluation |

## 🏁 What's Next?

You’re in the **feature analysis and interpretability phase** now.

Here are 3 logical directions you could pursue next:

1. **Feature steering** with DSPy → inject top ReasonScore features and observe generation change
2. **Build validation loop** using LLM to judge whether prompt was “more reasoning-capable”
3. **Layer sweep** — run SAEs across `layer_index=6,9,12,15` and compare ReasonScore distributions

Would you like to tackle prompt steering next, or build the feature sweep/validation system to rank your best features?Secretary
